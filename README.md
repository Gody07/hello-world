# hello-world


Hello you, anyone who's reading this. 
The tutorial of github made me write this. So i'm going to give you a bit of explanation about myself. 

I'm a real curious guy hitting the 30's. And i'm thinking, what the F am I doing with my life ? Even if i'm doing a loooot of different activities and sport. 
Still, i need to find something interesting to get my mind on and this platform reach out when i'm thinking about learning how to code. 

I know nothing at the moment. 
So, I hope i'll get something out of all this. 

Have an awesome day, you who took the time to read this. 
And of course, thanks for your time.
